QN - POWER OF FOUR (LEETCODE 342)


Approach  Bit Manipulation

A number is a power of four if:
Itâ€™s a power of two (only one bit set).
That bit is at an even position (0-indexed).


class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        // check power of two (only one bit set) and mask ensures bit at even position
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0 && (n & 0x55555555) != 0;
    }
}
